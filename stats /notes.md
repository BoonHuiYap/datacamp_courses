Things I want to do:

## Done

- Move the get data process into a script
 - It requires authentication and is just run once per day
 - Its really not part of the notebook process
- Add code to automatically run notebook to script

## To Do

- Put real month names into chart
- show the # of exercise completed on a given day as well as the total count in chart popup
- maybe remove the html and things from git tracking.
 - I don't want to commit every time i update the stats
- could also show a bar chart of each week. That would be interesting
 - This would show me what is reasonable/typical in a week. Then I can beat it.
 - made a prototype of this in the google doc and I like it.
 - I need to move it to the notebook though
- How many are done per work day each month (on average)? for me? for russ?
 - I think russ does about 10 a day on average. 4 days a week times 4 weeks is 16
 - he does about 160 a month over 16 work days so 10 a day??
 - I have been more variable, but I want to be at 600 a a month or about
 - 5 days a week for 4 weeks would mean i need to do 150 a week or 30 a day.
 - maybe a per day metric for each week would be neat. and emphasis consistency.
 - we think in exercise per day anyways so getting the average would be insightful
- I probably want to remove weekends from my analysis or put those exercies onto fridays
 - same for russ. He should only be analyzed on mon-thur days.
- move published html stats docs to rpubs so that they are not always messing up github
