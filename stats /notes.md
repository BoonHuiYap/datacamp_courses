Things I want to do:

- Move the get data process into a script
 - It requires authentication and is just run once per day
 - Its really not part of the notebook process
- Add code to automatically run notebook to script
- put real month names into chart
- show the # of exercise completed on a given day as well as the total count
- maybe remove the html and things from git tracking.
 - I don't want to commit every time i update the stats
